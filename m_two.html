					<h1>Have a website</h1>
					<img src="img/method/web.png">
					<p>The most important thing these days, when it comes to marketing a product, is having a website. This will give you a wider audience than any other type of marketing, is relatively cheap, and lends legitimacy to your business. It will also be necessary for some of the more effective marketing methods. If you really want your website to help you succeed, enable the sale of your product through the site.</p>
					<p>The simplest way to sell your product through your website will be to have an Amazon store where the product is available and use the storefront widget or link to the product on your site.</p>
				</li>
				<li data-cards-type='text'>
					<h1>Make a press release</h1>
					<img src="img/method/press.png">
					<p>For certain types of products, a press release might be a good idea. Find a media which is related to (ie. whose audience would be excited about) the type of product you are selling and give them a press release about your product becoming available. This is best for brand new products, especially those which are innovative in some way.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li data-cards-type='text'>
					<h1>Maximize social media</h1>
					<img src="img/method/social.png">
					<p>. Social media is a powerful marketing tool. You can use your own contacts to spread the word about your product (across Twitter, Facebook, or even sites like Pinterest) or you can use social media’s internal advertising (such as Facebook ads and sponsored posts).</p>
				</li>
							
				<li data-cards-type='text'>
					<h1>Use internet ads</h1>
					<img src="img/method/ads.png">
					<p>Another great marketing tool is internet banner ads. These ads, which would go up on websites which meet your audience criteria and budget, can funnel traffic into your website, allowing you to tell potential customers all about the wonders of your product.</p>
					<p>Use a reliable service to set up internet advertising (such as Project Wonderful) or work out a deal with local website owners if your product is better for a local audience.</p>
				</li>
				<li data-cards-type='text'>
					<h1>Be smart about email marketing</h1>
					<img src="img/method/mail.png">
					<p>If you have a website, consider an email marketing campaign. Send a well-crafted email telling these people why they should purchase your product, where they can get it, and give them a great hook (such as a sale) to draw them in. Remember: don’t be spammy!</p>
					<p>Collect the emails of customers during sales of either new or old products, purchase emails from a reputable service, or target specifically to interested parties who might be able to get the word out if they enjoy your product.</p>
				</li>
				<li data-cards-type='text'>
					<h1>Utilize digital coupons</h1>
					<img src="img/method/coupons.png">
					<p>People love to feel like they’re getting a great deal on something. Use digital coupons to draw customers in. You can use codes, print-out coupons for customers to bring to your store, or digital QR codes which can be displayed on a phone and scanned.</p>
				</li>
				<li data-cards-type='text'>
					<h1>Don't forget flyers, pamphlets, and postcards</h1>
					<img src="img/method/card.png">
					<p>You can also use more traditional methods of getting the word out. These methods work best for advertising and gaining customers in your local area. Make sure that your ad is easy to understand, looks attractive, and has some kind of hook to draw customers in. Flyers and pamphlets can be handed out or posted in allocated spots (such as store windows). Pamphlets and postcards can be mailed to street addresses in your local area.</p>
				</li>
				<li data-cards-type='text'>
					<h1>Use print advertising</h1>
					<img src="img/method/print.png">
					<p>You can also advertise in local print media. Get your ad in a newspaper, magazine, or other print media like phone books and real estate guides. This is easy to do, as you need only contact the advertising department for the companies which produce your chosen publication.</p>
				</li>
				<li data-cards-type='text'>
					<h1>Consider television ads</h1>
					<img src="img/method/tv.png">
					<p>If you have a large amount of money to produce a good television ad and get it to play on local television, this can be a good way to advertise to a broad audience. Unless you have very large amounts of money, however, you will probably be limited to local channels or daytime television, so only use this method if you think your ad will reach people who would actually buy your product.</p>
